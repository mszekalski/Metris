# Metris

# Background 

Metris is based on the classic computer game Tetris. Pieces fall from the top of the board and the players goal is to create a complete line across of blocks across it. When the line is complete the player accumulates points and the line of blocks dissapears and the blocks above fall into place. As the game progresses the pseed at which the pieces fall increases makeing it more difficult for the player to find a correct space for the block. If the game board becomes filled the game ends. A varaiation that I'm considering including is different piece shapes.
